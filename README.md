## Description

The application provides a REST endpoint that:
- Returns a list of all **unforked** repositories of the selected GitHub user, along with branches and SHA of recent commits,
- For a non-existent user, returns a 404 error with a readable message in JSON format.

The project serves as an example of good programming practice - full error handling, clean code, segregated DTOs and documentation.
